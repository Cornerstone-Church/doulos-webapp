            <p>I am deeply passionate about Jesus, my wife Brandi, my son Bennett, and Doulos. Seven years ago Doulos
                was birthed out of a dream to cultivate a community of young adults who love Jesus! Over the years God
                has been so faithful to be there every step of the way. I love this quote by Craig Groeschel "Our life
                is the sum total of small decisions we make" Each day I try to make small decisions that make me more
                like Jesus and love people the way He does! </p>

            <h1>Zach</h1>
            <p>I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted. I am only curious, curiosity is what brought me to
                God and his grace. Seeing my imperfection is what led me to my repentance, and through Jesus I am free
                from sin.

            <p>I love Jesus, my family, and spending time with others. I am passionate about young adults living like
                Jesus in every aspect of our lives. Doulos has been a place where I can be apart of what God wants to do
                in our community and in our world. My favorite past time is listening to and telling stories. Fun fact
                about myself I love taking on various spice challenges.</p>

            <h1>Adam</h1>
            <p>I have served the DOULOS community since the Lord led me here to Cornerstone Church in 2014, answering my
                prayer for a community that shares my heart for and relationship with Him. That same year He introduced
                me to my wife, Diana, as we served together on the worship team; 4 years later we were joyfully married.
                My passion is equipping people to see the awesomeness of God for themselves, the Love He has for them
                and the truth of Luke 10: 25-28. I enjoy music of all types, singing, thoughtful artistic expression,
                learning, connecting with people and cultures through language, sharing my story and hearing the life
                stories of others; all of which, I believe, are a part of the greater story that God is writing.</p>

            <p>"A encounter of love with Jesus was what changed the direction of my life in 2015."
                <br>My biggest dream it’s to take God’s love message to the whole world and exalt to Jesus my Savior. 
                I’m passionate about being able to help people around me specially with words of encouragement, i attend
                Cornerstone and I have the opportunity to serve in the ministry of Young Adults (Doulos) and Fusion
                Youth (FY). I am quite friendly and communicative, i love meeting new places, making new friends,
                reading the Bible and books that can help me to grow and keep my mind set, my favorite preacher and
                writer is Joyce Meyer, my favorite place is the beach, i’m a Dental Technician/Dental Assistant by
                profession, and I live each day expectantly to see how God is moving in our community. </p>

            <p>
                Love God & love people unconditionally. My desire is always to simply be a little vessel of God's love
                Emoji . I have a deep passion for people and the arts and I'm forever inspired to create through His
                creation. Music, painting, writing-- you name it, I'll love it! Share with me! God has shown me through
                the years what it is to bring beauty from ashes in my own life and I only wish to point people to Jesus
                so He can work through them to show them their own beauty. Seeing things from His eyes has changed my
                perspective in more than one way and has given me an appreciation of this beautiful life that God has
                given us and just a love for people. There is power in unity-- especially in unity with Christ. Hoping
                to just bring even a little speck of hope & joy to people’s lives through Christ now and eventually in
                missions. More of Him, less of me.

                I am a member of Cornerstone. I have been part of the young adults ministry since I came in 2010. Music
                is one of my passions, especially worship, that my husband Adam and I share. My desire is to help women
                and families, specifically ones with young infants, as motherhood can be most challenging at that age.
                As well, to help others through my testimony and the various challenging things in my life God has
                carried me through.

            <h1>Hiama</h1>
            <p>I began attending Cornerstone Church in September 2016. One of my favorite things about this church is
                the youth and diversity of its members. I’m passionate about sharing the gospel with young adults, and
                I’m always up for a random trip to the beach!</p>

            <p>I have actively been a part of Doulos for the past two years and continue to experience the blessing of
                growing in a community of new friendships with like-minded, passionate followers of Jesus. Impressed
                with the desire to pursue a career in medicine, Doulos provides the spiritual foundation and support
                needed to relentlessly follow after God’s voice amid discouragement or distractions and allow myself to
                be used for His glory. God has the responsibility to open the door, we have the responsibility to say
                yes.</p>

            <h1>Kristen</h1>
            <p>I am first and foremost a worshiper of Jesus, completely in awe of His goodness and mercy. Currently I am
                the department chair and music teacher at Greenbelt ES and have the privilege of leading worship at
                Doulos and serving as a youth leader for Fusion. I love to travel and celebrate the uniqueness of Gods
                creation as well as read, paint, and play music. I am also a foodie and do my best work in the presence
                of Chinese food and fortune cookies. However, I am most passionate about helping others develop their
                God given gifts and walk out the lifestyle of a servant. “When I stand before God at the end of my life,
                I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, I used everything You
                gave me.” -Emma Bombeck. In every season of my life I am listening for His voice and trusting God’s
                heart, all the while singing praises at the feet of my King.</p>

            <p>I am just a simple girl who loves Jesus. Six years ago I moved from Puerto Rico with a desire to touch
                our world with original songs meant to worship God. It was a matter of time where God continuously
                teaches me that we were made to worship Him with everything we do, no matter where we are. I love the
                fact that God created us and loves us uniquely, therefore it is my desire to encourage the people that
                surround me to be who God intended them to be.

            <p>
                This is Travis Phelix here. I enjoy sports, nature (particularly the water and the sky) and making and
                building things with my own hands. One of my favorite passages of scripture is the golden rule (Matt
                7:12) treat others as you want to be treated. These are words to live by because everyone is made in
                God's image and we should treat them as such. Growing up I saw this rule put to the test quite often and
                also broke it myself. I was bullied and in turn bullied others. My mother always told me I have a big
                heart and I would believe her but also the pain of disappointment would cloud my judgement at times. I
                can often see Jesus in myself like how I love to marvel at His creation. How I care for others even when
                I feel so uncared for myself. Or how I like to see things come alive in the essence of carpentry and
                manual labor. God is in all and above all so I long to see God and love in every one amidst the chaos
                and heartache. Peace and Love, Travis.
